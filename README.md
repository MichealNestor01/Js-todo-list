# Js-todo-list
This is my first Javascript project, it is mostly from following a creative Javascript course on https://developedbyed.com/, there are some changes I have made however, I decided to make a custom filter, since styling html select boxes doesn't have too many options I followed a blog post describing how to create a custom select box out of spans and divs. I like this a significant amount more than default select boxes.  

I am very happy with the project, however in future I may add logic to save the state of a todo item in local storage not just the todo item itself. for example if you mark, 'do the cleaning' as completed. and refresh the page, 'do the cleaning' will be there but it wont be marked as completed.
